Namaste! I'm [Nihar](/nihar), a hobbyist systems programmer from India. 

This site is my small internet home. Here you'll find notes about my tech interests, things I've done, tips, and experiments. I want to make this website look minimalistic. So, there is no javascript and CSS class used on this site.
