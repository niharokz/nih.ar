Namaste! I'm [Nihar](/nihar), a hobbyist systems programmer from India. 

This site is my small internet home. Here you'll find notes about my tech interests, things I've done, tips, and experiments. I want to make this website look minimalistic. So, there is no javascript and CSS class used on this site.

## # project

* [Pidgeotto](https://pypi.org/project/pidgeotto/) -- Python based static page generator for web.
* [Websites](/website_collection.html) -- Collections of website designs, interface, blog sites.
* [Narch](https://codeberg.org/niharokz/narch) -- Some DIY command line tools to simplify workflow.
