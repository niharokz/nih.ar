It was the year 2003, and there I was, a wide-eyed 9-year-old, glued to the television screen, entranced by the epic battles unfolding in Dragon Ball Z on Cartoon Network. Little did I know, that was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with anime and manga.

Over the years, I've delved into countless manga series and immersed myself in their animated counterparts. Here's a glimpse into my anime and manga journey, from the classics to the must-watch list:
