It was the year 2003, and there I was, a wide-eyed 9-year-old, glued to the television screen, entranced by the epic battles unfolding in Dragon Ball Z on Cartoon Network. Little did I know, that was the beginning of a lifelong love affair with anime and manga.

Over the years, I've delved into countless manga series and immersed myself in their animated counterparts. Here's a glimpse into my anime and manga journey, from the classics to the must-watch list:


* One Piece
* One Punch Man
* Fullmetal Alchemist: Brotherhood
* Cowboy Bebop 
* Hunter x Hunter
* Steins;Gate
* Death Note 
* Sword Art Online

* Fairy Tail
* Fate/stay night
* Solo Levelling
* Dan Da Dan
* Demon Slayer
