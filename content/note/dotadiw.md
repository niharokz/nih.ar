title : "Back to Basics: Power of DOTADIW"
subtitle : "As hardware is becoming more capable and acceptable, developers are getting more freedom to add whatever features/bloat they want. As a result, modern-day software is becoming more and more bloated."

In a world where software seems to grow ever more complex and bloated, there's something refreshing about returning to the timeless principles of the UNIX philosophy. At the heart of this philosophy lies the simple yet profound concept of DOTADIW: Do One Thing and Do It Well.

Back in the 1980s and 1990s, when hardware resources were scarce and every byte counted, developers were forced to adhere to this principle out of necessity. Games like Dangerous Dave were marvels of efficiency, squeezing maximum enjoyment out of a mere 0.21 MB of space. With floppy disks as the pinnacle of portable storage, there was no room for excess. And yet, despite these limitations, software of that era was remarkably efficient and effective.

C, with its low-level capabilities and close relationship with system hardware, was the language of choice for many developers. Even after four decades, its simplicity and power endure, making it the go-to language for projects where performance and reliability are paramount.

The essence of DOTADIW lies in writing code that is minimal, understandable, and focused. Each component should have a clear purpose, with no extraneous features or functionality. By adhering to this principle, developers can create software that is not only easier to maintain and debug but also more reliable and efficient.

In a world where complexity often reigns supreme, embracing the simplicity of DOTADIW can be a breath of fresh air. Whether you're building a small utility or a large-scale application, remember the timeless wisdom of doing one thing and doing it well.
