Hey, I'm Nihar Samantaray. A self-taught backend developer and CLI Enthusiast.
I enjoy turning complex codes and projects into simple and modular ones.
I'm a big believer in keeping things simple and clean, that's why I'm a software minimalist!


By day, I am a System Engineer at [Edgeverve](https://www.edgeverve.com/finacle/) where we build modern banking applications. By night, I am an open-source developer.
On my free time, I happen to write a bunch of software that you can find on [gitlab](https://github.com/niharokz).
If you're looking for information about my professional life, check out my **[portfolio](/resume)**.

Beside coding, my hobbies are [crypto](/crypto), photography, [anime](/anime) and also regular stuff like roaming around with friends.


I will be happy to receive your feedback, doubts or suggestions in my inbox. ( [hi@nihars.com](mailto:hi@nihars.com) )
