## Hey there! 👋 I'm Nihar Samantaray

I'm a self-taught backend developer and a CLI (Command Line Interface) enthusiast, always on a mission to simplify the complexities of code. I thrive on turning complicated projects into clean, modular solutions – because for me, simplicity is key. I proudly embrace the philosophy of software minimalism – keeping things as straightforward and efficient as possible.

## What I Do

By day, I am a technical lead at [Msys Technologies](https://www.msystechnologies.com/), where we're shaping the future of modern banking applications. By night, I dive into the world of open-source development. You can check out my collection of projects and contributions on my [GitLab profile](https://gitlab.com/niharokz).

If you're curious about my professional journey, feel free to explore my [portfolio](/resume), which has more details on the work I’ve done.

## When I'm Not Coding...

You'll probably find me chasing my wanderlust, exploring new places, capturing moments through photography, or getting lost in an epic [anime](/anime) series. I'm always up for an adventure, whether it’s discovering hidden corners of the world or hanging out with friends.

If you're into coding, travel, or just want to chat about software or life, feel free to drop me a message at [hi@nihars.com](mailto:hi@nihars.com). I’d love to hear from you – whether it’s feedback, suggestions, or just a hello! 😊
