## Presently

- Turning 30 feels like stepping into a new chapter, where experience meets excitement for the future.
- These days, I'm embracing the freedom to work from anywhere, combining my love for travel with my professional life.
- I'm employed as a Technical Lead at [Msys Technologies](https://www.msystechnologies.com), where I dabble in all things tech.
- Ever the automator, I'm constantly finding ways to streamline the mundane with projects like [narch](https://gitlab.com/niharokz/narch).
- When I'm not deep in code, you can find me rocking out to Nirvana's timeless anthem, [Smells Like Teen Spirit](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hTWKbfoikeg).
- I also double as the designer and caretaker of this website, constantly tweaking and updating to keep it fresh.
- A self-proclaimed anime aficionado, I indulge in some quality [anime](/anime) whenever I can steal a moment.
- On the financial front, I'm dipping my toes into the worlds of the stock market, always eager to learn and experiment.
- And between it all, I find myself pondering the age-old questions of life's meaning and purpose, one step at a time â€“ quite literally, as I prefer stairs over elevators.

## Past Adventures

- I've called various places home, including [Dubai](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubai),[Windhoek](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windhoek), [Bengaluru](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bengaluru), and [Mysore](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mysore). But my roots trace back to the vibrant city of [Bhubaneswar, Odisha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhubaneswar).
- In the realm of coding, I cut my teeth on Java, honing my skills and embracing the challenges along the way.
