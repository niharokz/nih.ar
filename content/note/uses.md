What I use at work on a day to day basis, changes from time to time but Iâ€™ll try to keep this up to date.

## Hardware
* **Laptop**    :   Lenovo Ideapad 5. 16GB of ram with i5 processor is overkill.
* **Phone** :   Samsung Galaxy S22 Ultra
* **Watch** :   Samsung Galaxy Watch 4

## Laptop Apps
* **Operating System**  :   Btw I use Arch :) WITH WINDOWS!
* **Ricing**    :   DWM manager
* **Terminal**  :   Alacritty and MobaXterm(windows)
* **Browser**   :   Edge browser! It just works!
* **Editor**    :   Neovim. Notepad++.

## Mobile Apps
* **QuickEdit** :   Notepad of Android. This can be used as note taking app, coding app or even testing app.
* **NewPipe**   :   Its youtube without youtube.
* **Browser**   :   Brave browser. It's fast!

## Subscriptions
* **Email Service** :   [Zoho Mail](https://go.zoho.com/4r5). I have tried tutanota previously. But Zoho Mail ticks all the boxes I wanted.
* **Server**    :   [Linode](https://www.linode.com/lp/refer/?r=3ca2cdc5c593c9aee9d47d9a962769cb72485382). This site is hosted here.
