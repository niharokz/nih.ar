What I use at work on a day to day basis, changes from time to time but Iâ€™ll try to keep this up to date.

## Laptop Apps
* **Operating System**  :   Btw I use Arch :)
* **Ricing**    :   DWM manager
* **Terminal**  :   Alacritty.
* **Browser**   :   Vivaldi Browser. Good for customization and making it your own.
* **Editor**    :   Neovim.

## Mobile Apps
* **QuickEdit** :   Notepad of Android. This can be used as note taking app, coding app or even testing app.
* **NewPipe**   :   Its youtube without youtube.
* **Browser**   :   Brave browser. Fastest browser in phone as of now.

## Subscriptions
