Not being a front-end developer, I might be a fish out of water here. Nevertheless, let me take you on a trip down memory lane with some relics from my past web endeavors.

Ah, if only I had known about Git back then! Unfortunately, the source code for all these projects was lost when the hosting expired. A valuable lesson learned: always keep backups.

You can find the archived source code for nihars.in (2012-2016) and nihars.com (2016-2020) in [this repository](https://gitlab.com/niharokz/website_archive).

And that's not all! There are a few more websites I've tinkered with over the years, mostly on platforms like Blogspot. Here's a quick rundown:

- [techxcode](https://techx-code.blogspot.com): Another Blogspot experiment from 2014.
- [The Computer Wizards](https://the-computer-wizards.blogspot.com): A Blogspot-based tech blog from 2013.
- [g8write](https://g8write.blogspot.com): My second attempt at blogging in 2012.
- [niharwrite](https://niharsamantaray.blogspot.com): My very first blog in 2011.

Ah, the memories!
